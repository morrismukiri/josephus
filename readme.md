# Killing Game

## Challenge
### [Josephus problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem)
> 100 people standing in a circle in an order 1 to 100. No. 1 has a sword. He kills the next person (i.e. No. 2) and gives the sword to the next (i.e. No. 3). All people do the same until only 1 survives. Which number survives at the last? I want C++ program for this.

## Solution
A repository to contain the implementation in as many languages as I can. Hopefully.
